# [hareimports](https://sr.ht/~smlavine/hareimports)

hareimports is a tool to automatically add used imports and remove
unused imports in [Hare](https://harelang.org) source files. Similar to
goimports.

Source files are read from stdin. Unused imports are removed, and
unimported modules are imported; the result is printed to stdout.

Licensed under GPLv3.

*Very* WIP.
